                <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Assassins_(film)"><img src="pic/m3.jpg" width="200px" height="180px"></a>The Assassins, previously known as Bronze Sparrow Terrace or Bronze Sparrow Platform, is a Chinese historical drama film directed by Zhao Linshan, starring Chow Yun-fat as Cao Cao, a prominent warlord who became the de facto head of the central government in China towards the end of the Han dynasty. The film, released in October 2012,[1] focuses on Cao Cao's life in his later years[2] and depicts two assassination attempts on the warlord. The supporting cast includes Liu Yifei, Hiroshi Tamaki, Alec Su, Annie Yi, Qiu Xinzhi, Yao Lu and Ni Dahong. The film's Chinese title is a reference to the Bronze Sparrow Platform (铜雀台), a terrace constructed in 210 by Cao Cao in the ancient city of Ye (in present-day Handan, Hebei).</p>

                <h2>Three Kingdoms: Resurrection of the Dragon</h2>
                <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Kingdoms:_Resurrection_of_the_Dragon"><img src="pic/m2.jpg" width="240px" height="120px"></a>Three Kingdoms: Resurrection of the Dragon is a 2008 Hong Kong action war drama film loosely based on parts of the 14th-century Chinese classical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms. It was directed by Daniel Lee with a reported budget of US$25 million. The film is a joint production between Hong Kong, the People's Republic of China and South Korea.[4][5]

                    The film publicity said that the film's script received inspiration of Chapter 92 of Romance of the Three Kingdoms.[5] Patrick Frater of Variety said that the book is often cited as one of the four most important works in the corpus of Chinese literature.[6] The book is also frequently read in South Korea. Unlike the source material, which casts three sworn brothers as the protagonists, the film uses Zhao Zilong, played by Andy Lau, as the lead character.[7] The film was one of the two Three Kingdoms-related films being produced in 2007, with the other being John Woo's two-part 288-minute Red Cliff.[6]</p>

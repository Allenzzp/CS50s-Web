Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Hello Guys!

Let me have a short introduction of my first website, the web for The Romance of Three Kingdoms!

Trace back to year 2005, I was studying at grade 4 or grade 5. One day, I borrowed a book called 《The Romance of Three Kingdoms》from my classmate and since that on, I started to know a world which is full of heros and amazing stories. When I went to middle school, I was introduced the video game of Three kingdoms by my classmates. I was lucky because the first game I played was the most apprasing game produced by Koei. That game really surprised me and I played every game of Three Kingdoms released by Koei since then. I have to say The story of Three Kingdoms affects me a lot, so when I found out the topic of the website is about myself, I cannot help to introducing this amazing topic to others by making 4 webpages.

My website includes the page for main page, game, book and movies. I comprehensivelly introduced the origin of Three Kingdoms, and the movies and games inspired by it. Most of my content is from Wikipedia and Goodle pictures. I think I integrated all requirements listed in the project intro. Have fun and I am waiting for the advice to help me make this website better!

Sincerely,
Allen
